The user interface is opened by running any of the three files on the console.
All three are functionnal.
The JS script is run using node, with the module 'promt-sync'.
You will need to input the initial configuration for the scenario you wanna try.
Any configuration is functional. The elevators floor and destination are integers,
And directions are idle/up/down. Capacity is integer between zero and 15, but feel free to try
negative number or >15.
The perl Residential Controller file is in the repo https://github.com/kemtardif/Rocket_Elevators_Controllers/tree/secondbranch
The repo include a file named 'lib', whih are the packages for the Controller and Elevator classes. It is not 
functionnal, but since I spent a day on it, it's still there :) Thank you!
